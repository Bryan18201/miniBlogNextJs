Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its portability, platform independence, and strong emphasis on object-oriented programming. Originally developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), Java allows developers to write code that can run on different operating systems and devices with the help of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 

It's commonly used for a wide range of applications, including web development, mobile app development (Android), enterprise software, and more. Java is valued for its reliability, security, and large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. It's an essential language in the world of software development.
