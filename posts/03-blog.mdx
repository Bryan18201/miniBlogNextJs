Python is a high-level, versatile, and dynamically-typed programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has gained widespread popularity in a wide range of application domains, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and automation. Key characteristics and features of Python include:

**Readability:** Python's clean and easy-to-read syntax, which emphasizes code indentation, makes it accessible to both novice and experienced programmers.

**Interpreted Language:** Python is an interpreted language, meaning that you can write and run code without the need for explicit compilation. This promotes rapid development and testing.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Python is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing developers to write code that works across different operating systems.

**Extensive Standard Library:** Python comes with a rich standard library that provides modules and packages for a wide range of tasks, making it a powerful language for various applications.

**Large Ecosystem:** Python has a vast and active community that contributes to a wide range of libraries and frameworks, such as Django for web development, NumPy and Pandas for data analysis, and TensorFlow for machine learning.

**Dynamic Typing:** Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. This simplifies coding but can sometimes lead to runtime errors if not used carefully.

**Object-Oriented:** Python supports object-oriented programming principles and allows developers to work with classes and objects.

**Versatility:** Python can be used for a broad array of tasks, from web development and automation to data analysis, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence.

**Community and Support:** The Python community is vibrant and supportive, providing extensive documentation, forums, and resources for learning and problem-solving.

## Example of code

```sh
ptyhon --version
```

```py
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
total = 0

# Calculate the sum of numbers
for num in numbers:
    total += num

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of numbers is: {total}")
```
